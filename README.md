# Scroller

Scroller is a poorly-named blogging and social networking platform focussing on **text-based** interaction. Its goal is to move away from the image/video heavy direction most sites are going and focus on quick page load times while minimising visual distraction and facilitating easy interaction.

This is a capstone project submission for a Code Institute course, as such it was written quickly in Python/Django with some design stipulations that aren't ideal in terms of usability. *This should not be used in production environments*. I intend to rewrite it in a more scalable manner.

## Design considerations
